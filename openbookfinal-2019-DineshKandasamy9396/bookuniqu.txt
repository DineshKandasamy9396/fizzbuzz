of
a
young
man
of
extraordinary

in

of
some
little
distance
was
sitting
the
artist
whose
sudden
some
years
ago
at
the
such
public
excitement
and
gave
rise
to
so
many
strange
the
painter
looked
at
the

form
he
had
so
in
his
a
smile
of
pleasure
passed
across
his

seemed
about
to
linger
he

closing

his
fingers
upon

though
he
sought
to
imprison
within
his
brain
some
curious
dream
from
which
he
feared
he
might

your
best
the
best
thing
you
have
ever
said
must
certainly
send
it
next
year
to

too
have
gone

have
been
either
so
many
people
that
have
not
been
able
to
see
the
which
was
or
so
many
pictures
that
have
not
been
able
to
see
the
which
was
is
really
the
only
think
shall
send
it
he
his
head
back
in
that
odd
way
that
used
to
make
his
friends
laugh
at
him
at

looked
at
him
in
through
the

blue
of

you
any
odd
you
painters
do
anything
in
the
world
to
gain

as
you
have
you
seem
to
want
to
throw
it

silly
of
for
there
is
only
one
thing
in
the
world
worse
than
being
talked
and
that
is
not
being
talked
portrait
like
this
would
set
you
far
above
all
the
young
men
in

make
the
old
men
quite
if
old
men
are
ever
capable

laugh
at

put
too
much
of
myself
into

himself
out
on
the
and
knew
you
but
it
is
quite
all
the
much
of
yourself
in
my
know
you
were
so
and
really
see
any
between
with
your
rugged
strong
face
and
your
and
this
young
who
looks
as
if
he
was
made
out
of
ivory
and
my
dear
he
is
a
and
of
course
you
have
an
intellectual
expression

all
real
ends
where
an
intellectual
expression
is
in
itself
a
mode
of

the
harmony

he
was
a
boy
of

as
a
natural
consequence
he
always
looks
absolutely
mysterious
young
whose
name
you
have
never
told
but
whose
picture
really
never
feel
quite
sure
of
is
some
beautiful
creature
who
should
be
always
here
in
winter
when
we
have
no
flowers
to
look

always
here
in

we
want
something
to

sort
of
that

better
not
to
be
different
from
ugly

the
stupid

the
best
of
it
in
this
can
sit
at
their
ease
and
at
the
they
know
nothing
of
they
are
at

the
knowledge
of
live
as
we
all
should

without
neither

why
like
people
never
tell
their
names
to
any
is
like
a
part
of

grown
to
love

to
be
the
one
thing
that
can
make
modern
life
mysterious
or
to
thing
is
delightful
if
one
only
hides
leave
town
now
never
tell
my
people
where
am
would
lose
all
my
is
a
silly
dare
but
somehow
it
seems
to
bring
a
great
deal
of
romance
into
suppose
you
think
me
foolish
about
at
answered
at
my
dear
seem
to
forget
that
am
and
the
one
charm
of
marriage
is
that
it
makes
a
life
of
deception
absolutely
necessary
for
both
never
know
where
my
wife
and
my
wife
never
knows
what
am
we
do
meet
when
we
dine
out
or
go
down
to
the
tell
each
other
the
most
absurd
stories
with
the
most
serious
wife
is
very
good
at
in
than
never
gets
confused
over
her
and
always
when
she
does
find
me
she
makes
no
row
at
sometimes
wish
she
but
she
merely
laughs
at
hate
the
way
you
talk
about
your
married
said
towards
the
door
that
led
into
the
believe
that
you
are
really
a
very
good
but
that
you
are
thoroughly
ashamed
of
your
own
are
an
extraordinary
never
say
a
moral
and
you
never
do
a
wrong
is
simply
a
natural
is
simply
a
and
the
most
pose
cried
and
the
two
young
men
went
out
into
the
garden
together
and
themselves
on
a
long
bamboo
seat
that
stood
in
the
shade
of
a
tall
laurel

slipped
over
the
polished

on
your
answering
a
question
put
to
you
some
time

keeping
his
eyes
fixed
on
the

will
tell
you
what
it
want
you
to
explain
to
me
why
you
exhibit
want
the
real
told
you
the
real
you
did
said
it
was
because
there
was
too
much
of
yourself
in
that
is
said
looking
him
straight
in
the
portrait
that
is
painted
with
feeling
is
a
portrait
of
the
not
of
the
is
merely
the
the
is
not
he
who
is
revealed
by
the
it
is
rather
the
painter
on
the
coloured
reveals
reason
will
not
exhibit
this
picture
is
that
am
afraid
that
have
shown
in
it
the
secret
of
my
own
what
is
he
will
tell
said
but
an
expression
of

over
his

is
really
very
little
to

the
am
afraid
you
will
hardly
understand
you
will
hardly
believe
and
leaning
a
daisy
from
the
grass
and
examined

quite
sure
shall
understand

at
the
little
as

that
it

some
from

the

their
clustering

like
a
blue
thread
a
long
thin
past
on
its
brown
felt
as
if
he
could
hear
heart
and
wondered
what
was
story
is
simply
said
the
painter
after
some
months
ago
went
to
a
crush
at
know
we
poor
artists
have
to
show
ourselves
in
society
from
time
to
just
to
remind
the
public
that
we
are
not
an
evening
coat
and
a
white
as
you
told
me
even
a
can
gain
a
reputation
for
being
after
had
been
in
the
room
about
ten
talking
to
huge
and
suddenly
became
conscious
that
some
one
was
looking
at
turned
round
and
saw
for
the
first
our
eyes
felt
that
was
growing
curious
sensation
of
terror
came
over
knew
that
had
come
face
to
face
with
some
one
whose
mere
personality
was
so
fascinating
if
allowed
it
to
do
it
would
absorb
my
whole
my
whole
my
very
art
did
not
want
any
external
influence
in
my
know
how
independent
am
by
have
always
been
my
own
had
at
least
always
been
till
met
know
how
to
explain
it
to
seemed
to
tell
me
that
was
on
the
verge
of
a
terrible
crisis
in
my
had
a
strange
feeling
that
fate
had
in
store
for
me
exquisite
joys
and
exquisite
grew
afraid
and
turned
to
quit
the
was
not
conscience
that
made
me
do
it
was
a
sort
of
take
no
credit
to
myself
for
trying
to
and
are
really
the
same
is
the
of
the
is
believe
and
believe
you
do
whatever
was
my
it
may
have
been
for
used
to
be
very
certainly
struggled
to
the
of

not
going
to
run
away
so
she
know
her
she
is
a
peacock
in
everything
but
said
pulling
the
daisy
to
bits
with
his
long
nervous
could
not
get
rid
of
brought
me
up
to
and
people
with
stars
and
and
elderly
ladies
with
gigantic
and
parrot
spoke
of
me
as
her
had
only
met
her
once
but
she
took
it
into
her
head
to
believe
some
picture
of
mine
had
made
a
great
success
at
the
at
least
had
been
about
in
the
penny
which
is
the
standard
of
found
myself
face
to
face
with
the
young
man
whose
personality
had
so
were
quite
almost
eyes
met
was
of
but
asked
to
introduce
me
to
it
was
not
so
after
was
simply
would
have
spoken
to
each
other
without
any
am
sure
of
told
me
so
felt
that
we
were
destined
to
know
each
how
did
describe
this
wonderful
young
asked
his
know
she
goes
in
for
giving
a
rapid
of
all
her
remember
her
bringing
me
up
to
a
and
old
gentleman
covered
all
over
with
orders
and
and
into
my
in
a
tragic
whisper
which
must
have
been
perfectly
audible
to
everybody
in
the
the
most
simply
like
to
find
out
people
for
treats
her
guests
exactly
as
an

his
either
explains
them
entirely

tells
one
everything
about

except
what
one
wants
to

said
dear
she
tried
to
found
a

only
succeeded
in
opening

admire
tell
what
did
she
say
about
something
dear
mother
and
absolutely
forget
what
he
do
plays
the
is
it
the
dear
of
us
could
help
and
we
became
friends
at
is
not
at
all
a
bad
beginning
for
a
and
it
is
far
the
best
ending
for

the
young

what

what
for

a
great

all
men
of
some

and
consequently
they
all
appreciate
that
very
vain
of

rather
should
think
it
according
to
your
category

merely
an

old
you
are

more

my
younger
brothers

never
to
do
anything
dear

suppose
it
comes
from
the
fact
that
none
of
us
can
stand
other
people
having
the
same
faults
as
quite
with
the
rage
of
the
democracy
against
what
they
call
the
vices
of
the
upper
masses
feel
that

that
if
any

you

to
never
dreams
of

whether
the

only
thing
he

whether

it
the

of

nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
of
the

that
the

you

never

for
anything
but
your

all
my
art
to
me
said
the
painter
sometimes
that
there
are
only
two
eras
of
any
importance
in
the
first
is
the
appearance
of
a
new
medium
for
and
the
second
is
the
appearance
of
a
new
personality
for
art
the
invention

to
the
the
face
of

to
late
and
the
face
of
will
some
day
be
to

not
merely
that
paint
from

from

from
have
done
all
he
is
much
more
to
me
than
a
model
or
a
tell
you
that
am
with
what
have
done
of
or
that
his
beauty
is
such
that
art
express
is
nothing
that
art
and
know
that
the
work
have
since
met
is
good
is
the
best
work
of
my
in
some
curious
wonder
will
you
understand
personality
has
suggested
to
me
an
entirely
new
manner
in
an
entirely
new
mode
of
see
things
think
of
them
can
now
life
in
a
way
that
was
hidden
from
me
dream
of
form
in
days
of
is
it
who
says
but
it
is
what
has
been
to
merely
visible
presence
of
this
he
seems
to
me
little
more
than
a
though
he
is
really
over
merely
visible
wonder
can
you
realize
all
that
that
he
defines
for
me
the
lines
of
a
fresh
a
school
that
is
to
have
in
it
all
the
passion
of
the
romantic
all
the
perfection
of
the
spirit
that
is
harmony
of
soul
and
much
that
in
our
madness
have
separated
the
and
have
invented
a
realism
that
is
an
that
is
if
you
only
knew
what
is
to
remember
that
landscape
of
for
which
offered
me
such
a
huge
price
but
which
would
not
part
is
one
of
the
best
things
have
ever
why
is
it
while
was
painting
sat
beside
subtle
influence
passed
from
him
to
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
saw
in
the
plain
woodland
the
wonder
had
always
looked
for
and
always
this
is
must
see
got
up
from
the
seat
and
walked
up
and
down
the
some
time
he
came
he
is
to
me
simply
a
motive
in
might
see
nothing
in
see
everything
in
is
never
more
present
in
my
work
than
when
no
image
of
him
is
is
a
as
have
of
a
new
find
him
in
the
curves
of
certain
in
the
and
of
certain
is
why
you
exhibit
his
asked
without
have
put
into
it
some
expression
of
all
this
curious
artistic
of
of
have
never
cared
to
speak
to
knows
nothing
about
shall
never
know
anything
about
the
world
might
guess
and
will
not
bare
my
soul
to
their
shallow
heart
shall
never
be
put
under
their
is
too
much
of
myself
in
the
much
of
are
not
so
as
you
know
how
useful
passion
is
for
a
broken
heart
will
run
to
many
hate
them
for
cried
artist
should
create
beautiful
but
should
put
nothing
of
his
own
life
into
live
in
an
age
when
men
treat
art
as
if
it
were
meant
to
be
a
form
of
have
lost
the
abstract
sense
of
day
will
show
the
world
what
it
and
for
that
reason
the
world
shall
never
see
my
portrait
of
think
you
are
but
argue
with
is
only
the
lost
who
ever
is
very
fond
of
painter
considered
for
a
few
likes
he
answered
after
a
know
he
likes
course
him
find
a
strange
pleasure
in
saying
things
to
him
that
know
shall
be
sorry
for
having
a
he
is
charming
to
and
we
sit
in
the
studio
and
talk
of
a
thousand
and
he
is
and
seems
to
take
a
real
delight
in
giving
me
that
have
given
away
my
whole
soul
to
some
one
who
treats
it
as
if
it
were
a
flower
to
put
in
his
a
bit
of
decoration
to
charm
his
an
ornament
for
a
in
are
apt
to
you
will
tire
sooner
than
he
is
a
sad
thing
to
think
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
genius
lasts
longer
than
accounts
for
the
fact
that
we
all
take
such
pains
to
the
wild
struggle
for
we
want
to
have
something
that
and
so
we
fill
our
minds
with
rubbish
and
in
the
silly
hope
of
keeping
our
thoroughly
is
the
modern
the
mind
of
the
thoroughly
man
is
a
is
like
a
all
monsters
and
with
everything
priced
above
its
proper
think
you
will
tire
all
the
day
you
will
look
at
your
and
he
will
seem
to
you
to
be
a
little
out
of
or
you
like
his
tone
of
or
will
him
in
your
own
and
seriously
think
that
he
has
very
badly
to
next
time
he
you
will
be
perfectly
cold
and
will
be
a
great
for
it
will
alter
you
have
told
me
is
quite
a
a
romance
of
art
one
might
call
and
the
worst
of
having
a
romance
of
any
kind
is
that
it
leaves
one
so
talk
like
long
as
the
personality
of
will
dominate
feel
what
change
too
my
dear
that
is
exactly
why
can
feel
who
are
faithful
know
only
the
trivial
side
of
it
is
the
who
know
struck
a
light
on
a
silver
case

began
to
smoke
a
cigarette

more
delightful

to

the
passions
of

the
fascinating
things
in

to
himself
with
silent
amusement
the
luncheon
that
he
had
missed
by
staying
so
long
with
he
gone
to
his
he
would
have
been
sure
to
have
met
and
the
whole
conversation
would
have
been
about
the
feeding
of
the
poor
and
the
necessity
for
model

have
the
importance
of
those
for
whose
exercise
there

to
insist
upon
to
oblige

to
oblige
said
at
his

it
must
be
for
my
unfortunate
beg
you

what
about

think
there
will
be
any
difficulty
about
down
get
up
on
the
and
move
about
too
or
pay
any
attention
to
what
has
a
very
bad
influence
over
all
his
with
the
single
exception
of
stepped
up
on
the
dais
with
the
air
of
a
young
and
made
a
little
of
to
to
whom
he
had
rather
taken
a
was
so
unlike
made
a
delightful
he
had
such
a
beautiful
a
few
moments
he
said
to
you
really
a
very
bad
bad
as
is
no
such
thing
as
a
good
influence
is
from
the
scientific
point
of
to
influence
a
person
is
to
give
him
own
does
not
think
his
natural
or
burn
with
his
natural
virtues
are
not
real
to
if
there
are
such
things
as
are
becomes
an
echo
of
some
one
an
actor
of
a
part
that
has
not
been
written
for
aim
of
life
is
realize
nature
is
what
each
of
us
is
here
are
afraid
of
have
forgotten
the
highest
of
all
the
duty
that
one
owes
to
they
are
feed
the
hungry
and
clothe
the
their
own
souls
and
are

gone
out
of

never
really

the

of
the
terror

the
two
things
that
govern

your
head
a
little
more
to
the
like
a
good
said
the
deep
in
his
work
and
conscious
only
that
a
look
had
come
into
the
face
that
he
had
never
seen
there
continued
in
his
musical
and
with
that
graceful
wave
of
the
hand
that
was
always
so
characteristic
of
and
that
he
had
even
in
his
believe
that
if
one
man
were
to
live
out
his
life
fully
and
were
to
give
form
to
every
expression
to
every
reality
to
every
believe
that
the
world
would
gain
such
a
fresh
impulse
of
joy
that
we
would
forget
all
the
of
and
return
to
the
something
richer
than

it
may
the
man
amongst

afraid
of
of
the
savage

its
tragic
survival
in

then
but
the
of
a
or
the
luxury
of
a
only
way
to
get
rid
of
a
temptation
is
to
yield
to
and
your
soul
grows
sick
with
longing
for
the
things
it
has
forbidden
to
with
desire
for
what
its
laws
have
made
and
has
been
said
that
the
great
events
of
the

in

and
the
brain
that
the
great
sins
of
the
world
take
place
you
with
your
youth
and
your
you
have
had
passions
that
have
made
you
thoughts
that
have
filled
you
with
and
sleeping
dreams
whose
mere
memory
might
stain
your
cheek
with
you
know
what
to
is
some
answer
to
but
find
me
let
me
try
not
to
nearly
ten
minutes
he
stood
with
parted
lips
and
eyes
was
conscious
that
entirely
fresh
influences
were
at
work
within
they
seemed
to
him
to
have
come
really
from
few
words
that
friend
had
said
to
spoken
by
no
and
with
paradox
in
touched
some
secret
chord
that
had
never
been
touched
but
that
he
felt
was
now
vibrating
and
to
curious
had
him
like
had
troubled
him
many
music
was
not
was
not
a
new
but
rather
another
that
it
created
in
terrible
they
and
and
could
not
escape
from
yet
what
a
subtle
magic
there
was
in
seemed
to
be
able
to
give
a
plastic
form
to
and
to
have
a
music
of
their
own
as
sweet
as
that
of
viol
or
of
there
anything
so
real
as
there
had
been
things
in
his
that
he
had
not
understood
them
suddenly
became
to
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
walking
in
had
he
not
known
his
subtle
watched
knew
the
precise
psychological
moment
when
to
say
felt
was
amazed
at
the
sudden
impression
that
his
words
had
remembering
a
book
that
he
had
read
when
he
was
a
book
which
had
revealed
to
him
much
that
he
had
not
known
he
wondered
whether
was
passing
through
a
similar
had
merely
shot
an
arrow
into
the
it
hit
the
fascinating
the
lad
painted
away
with
that
bold
touch
of
that
had
the
true
refinement
and
perfect
that
in
at
any
rate
comes
only
from

certainly
made
you
have
the
most
wonderful
suppose
he
has
been
paying
you

a
word
that
he

my
masterpiece
as
it
went
out
to
the
garden
and
found
his
face
in
the
great
cool
drinking
in
their
perfume
as
if
it
had

close
to
him

the
lad
started
and
drew

and
the
leaves
had
tossed
his
and
all
their
was
a
look
of
fear
in
his
such
as
people
have
when
they
are
suddenly
finely
and
some
hidden
nerve
shook
the
scarlet
of
his
lips
and
left
them
continued

one
of
the
great
secrets
of
cure
the
soul
by
means
of

turned
his
head

not
help
liking
the
graceful
young
man
who
was
standing
by

something
in
his
low
voice
that
was
absolutely

a
curious
as

seemed
to
have
a
language
of

it
been
left
for
a
stranger
to
reveal
him
to

known
for

the
friendship
between
them
had
never

had
come
some
one
across
his
life
who
seemed
to
have
disclosed
to
him
what
was
there
to

turned
his

then
a

an
exquisite
poison
in

a
passion
for
one
evening
about
seven
determined
to
go
out
in

of
some

that
this

of
with
its
of
its
and
its
splendid
as
you
once
must
have
something
in

for
a
thousand
mere
danger
gave
me
a
sense
of
remembered
what
you
had
said
to
me
on
that
wonderful
evening
when
we
first
about
the
search
for
beauty
being
the
real
secret
of
know
what
but
went
out
and
soon
losing
my
way
in
a
of
streets
and
black
eight
passed
by
an
absurd
little
with
great
and
in
the
most
amazing
ever
in
my
was
standing
at
the
smoking
a
vile
had
and
an
enormous
diamond
in
the
centre
of
a
a

when
he
saw
and
he
took
off
his
hat
with
an
air
of
gorgeous
was
something
about
that
was
such
a
will
laugh
at
but
really
went
in
and
paid
a
whole
guinea
for
the
the
present
day
make
out
why
did
and
yet
if
dear
if
should
have
missed
the
greatest
romance
of
my
see
you
are

of
am
not
at

am
not
laughing
at
you
should
not
say
the
greatest
romance
of
your
should
say
the
first
romance
of
your
will
always
be
and
you
will
always
be
in
love
with
is
the
privilege
of
people
who
have
nothing
to
is
the
one
use
of
the
idle
classes
of
a
be

exquisite
things
in

for

merely
the
you
think
my
nature
so
cried
think
your
nature
so
do
you
dear
the
people
who
love
only
once
in
their
lives
are
really
the
shallow
they
call
their
and
their
call
either
the
of
custom
or
their
lack
of

the
emotional
life
what
consistency
is
to
the
life
of

a
confession
of

analyse

some
passion
for

in
are
many
things
that
we
would
throw
away
if
we
were
not
afraid
that
others
might

to
interrupt
on
with

seated
in
a
little
private
with
a
staring

in

out
from

curtain
and
surveyed
the

a
all
and
like
a
gallery
and
pit
were
fairly
but
the
two
rows
of
stalls
were
quite
and
there
was
hardly
a
person
in
what
suppose
they
called
the
went
about
with
and
and
there
was
a
terrible
consumption
of
nuts
going
must
have
been
just
like
the
days
of
the
should
and
very
began
to
wonder
what
on
earth
should
do
when
caught
sight
of
the
do
you
think
the
play
should
think
or
but
fathers
used
to
like
that
sort
of
longer
the
more
feel
that
whatever
was
good
enough
for
our
fathers
is
not
good
enough
for
as
in
ont
play
was
good
enough
for
was
and
must
admit
that
was
rather
annoyed
at
the
idea
of
seeing
done
in
such
a
hole
of
a

a
sort
of

to
wait

a
over
by
a
young
who
sat
at
a
cracked
that
nearly
drove
me
but
at
last
the
was
drawn
up
and
the
play
was
a
stout
elderly
with
a
husky
tragedy
and
a
figure
like
a
was
almost
as
was
played
by
the
who
had
introduced
of
his
own
and
was
on
most
friendly
terms
with

both
as
as
the

that
looked
as
if
it
had
come
out
of
a
imagine
a
hardly
seventeen
years
of
with
a
a
small
head
with
of
eyes
that
were
violet

hardly
see

the
mist
of

that
came
across

very
low
at
with
deep
notes
that
seemed
to
fall
singly
upon

became
a
little
and
sounded
like
a
flute
or
a
distant
the
it
had
all
the
ecstasy
that
one
hears
just
before
dawn
when
are

later
when
it
had
the
wild
passion
of
know
how
a
voice
can
stir

and
the
voice
of

two
things
that
shall
never
close
my
hear

each
of
them
says
something

everything

round
to
the
box
after
the
performance
was
over
and
offered
to
take
me
behind
the
scenes
and
introduce
me
to

furious
with

told
him
that
had
been
dead
for
hundreds
of
years
and
that
her
body
was
lying
in
a
marble
tomb
in
from
his
blank
look
of
that
he
was
under
the
impression
that
had
taken
too
much
or
am
not
he
asked
me
if
wrote
for
any
of
the
told
him
never
even
read
seemed
terribly
disappointed
at
and
to
me
that
all
the
dramatic
critics
were
in
a
conspiracy
against

that
they
were
every
one
of
them
to

not

was
quite
right
on
the
other
judging
from
their
most
of

be
at
all
he
seemed
to
think
they
were
beyond

this
the
lights
were
being
put
out
in
the
and
had
to
wanted
me
to
try
some
cigars
that
he
strongly
next
of
arrived
at
the
place
he
saw
he
made
me
a
low
bow
and
assured
me
that
was
a
patron
of
was
a
most
offensive
though
he
had
an
extraordinary
passion
for
told
me
with
an
air
of
that
his
five
bankruptcies
were
entirely
due
to
as
he
insisted
on
calling
seemed
to
think
it
a
was
a
my
dear
great
people
become
bankrupt
through
having
invested
too
heavily
in
the
prose
of

so
shy
and
so
is
something
of
a
child
about

opened
wide
in
exquisite
wonder
when
told
her
what
thought
of
her

she
seemed
quite
unconscious
of
her

we
were
both
rather
old

at
the
of
the
dusty
making
elaborate
speeches
about
us
while
we

looking
at
each
other
like

insist
on
calling

and
shall
write
to

not
laid
eyes
on
him
for
a
is
rather
of
as
he
has
sent
me
my
portrait
in
the
most
wonderful
specially
designed
by
though
am
a
little
jealous
of
the
picture
for
being
a
whole
month
younger
than
must
admit
that
delight
in
you
had
better
write
to
want
to
see
him
says
things
that
annoy
gives
me
good
are
very
fond
of
giving
away
what
they
need
most
is
what
call
the
depth
of
is
the
best
of
but
he
seems
to
me
to
be
just
a
bit
of
a
have
known
have
discovered
my
dear
puts
everything
that
is
charming
in
him
into
his
consequence
is
that
he
has
nothing
left
for
life
but
his
his
and
his
common
only
artists
have
ever
known
who
are
personally
delightful
are
bad
artists
exist
simply
in
what
they
and
consequently
are
perfectly
in
what
they
great
a
really
great
is
the
most
of
all
inferior
poets
are
absolutely
worse
their
rhymes
the
more
picturesque
they
mere
fact
of
having
published
a
book
of
makes
a
man
quite
lives
the
poetry
that
he
others
write
the
poetry
that
they
dare
not
wonder
is
that
really
said
putting
some
perfume
on
his
out
of
a
bottle
that
stood
on
the
must
if
you
say
now
am
is
waiting
for
forget
about
he
left
the
heavy
and
he
began
to
few
people
had
ever
interested
him
so
much
as
and
yet
the
mad
of
some
one
else
caused
him
not
the
of
or
was
pleased
by
made
him
a
more
interesting
had
been
always
by
the
methods
of
natural
but
the
ordinary
of
that
science
had
seemed
to
him
trivial
and
of
no
so
he
had
begun
by
as
he
had
ended
by
appeared
to
him
the
one
thing
worth
to
it
there
was
nothing
else
of
any
was
true
that
as
one
watched
life
in
its
curious
of
pain
and
one
could
not
wear
over
face
a
mask
of
nor
keep
the
fumes
from
the
brain
and
making
the
imagination
with
and
were
so
subtle
that
to
know
their
properties
one
had
to
of
were
so
strange
that
one
had
to
pass
through
them
if
one
sought
to
understand
their
what
a
great
reward
one
wonderful
the
whole
world
became
to
note
the
curious
hard
logic
of
and
the
emotional
coloured

the
union
of

with

a
mystery

to
wonder
whether
we
could
ever
make
psychology
so
absolute
a
science
that
each
little
spring
of
life
would
be
revealed
to

that

transformed
by
the
of

something
that
seemed
to
the
lad
himself
to
be
remote
from

for
that
very
reason
all
the
more

yet
she
felt
no

some
measure
it
was
a
disappointment
to
of
the
question

direct
situation

led
up
was
reminded
her
of
a
bad
she
wondering
at
the
harsh
simplicity
of

broke
from
his

a
who
is
in

says
he
a
moment
a
sense
of
humiliation
came
over
the
head
her
eyes
with
shaking
has
a
she
had
lad
was
went
towards
and
he
kissed
am
sorry
if

you
by
asking
about
my
he
could
not

must
go
forget
that
you
will
have
only
one
child
now
to
look
and
believe
me
that
if
this
man
my
will
find
out
who
he
track
him
and
kill
him
like
a

of
the
the
passionate

that
accompanied
the
mad
made
life
seem
more
vivid
to
was
familiar
with
the
more
and
for
the
first
time
for
many
months
she
really
her
would
have
liked
to
have
continued
the
scene
on
the
same
emotional
but
he
cut
her
had
to
be
carried
down
and
looked
in
and
was
the
bargaining
with
the
moment
was
lost
in
was
with
a
renewed
feeling
of
disappointment
that
she
the
lace
from
the
as
her
son
drove
was
conscious
that
a
great
opportunity
had
been
herself
by
telling
how
she
felt
her
life
would
now
that
she
had
only
one
child
to
look
remembered
the
had
pleased
the
threat
she
said
was
and
dramatically
felt
that
they
would
all
laugh
at
it
some
suppose
you
have
heard
the
said
that
evening
as
was
shown
into
a
little
private
room
at
the
where
dinner
had
been
laid
for
answered
the
giving
his
hat
and
coat
to
the
is
about
interest
is
hardly
a
single
person
in
the
of
worth
though
many
of
them
would
be
the
better
for
a
little
is
engaged
to
be
said
watching
him
as
he
started
and
then
engaged
to
be
he
is
perfectly
some
little
actress
or
believe
is
far
too
is
far
too
wise
not
to
do
foolish
things
now
and
my
dear
is
hardly
a
thing
that
one
can
do
now
and
in
say
he
was
said
he
was
engaged
to
be
is
a
great
have
a
distinct
remembrance
of
being
but
have
no
at
all
of
being
am
inclined
to
think
that
never
was
think
of
and
and
would
be
absurd
for
him
to
marry
so
much
beneath
you
want
to
make
him
marry
this
tell
him
is
sure
to
do
a
man
does
a
thoroughly
stupid
it
is
always
from
the
hope
the
girl
is
want
to
see
tied
to
some
vile
who
might
his
nature
and
ruin
his
she
is
better
than
is
a
glass
of
and
says
she
is
and
he
is
not
often
wrong
about
things
of
that
portrait
of
him
has
his
appreciation
of
the
personal
appearance
of
other
has
had
that
excellent
amongst
are
to
see
her
if
that
boy
forget
his
you
should
be
miserable
if
thought
should
ever
be
more
serious
than
am
at
the
present
do
you
approve
of
asked
the
walking
up
and
down
the
room
and
biting
his
approve
of
is
some
silly
never
or
of
anything
is
an
absurd
attitude
to
take
towards
are
not
sent
into
the
world
to
air
our
moral
never
take
any
notice
of
what
common
people
and
never
interfere
with
what
charming
people
a
personality
whatever
mode
of
expression
that
personality
selects
is
absolutely
delightful
to
falls
in
love
with
a
beautiful
girl
who
acts
and
proposes
to
marry
he
he
would
be
none
the
less
know
am
not
a
champion
of
real
to
marriage
is
that
it
makes
one
people
are
lack
there
are
certain
that
marriage
makes
more
retain
their
and
add
to
it
many
other
are
forced
to
have
more
than
one
become
more
highly
and
to
be
highly
organized
should
the
object
of
every
experience
is
of
and
whatever
one
may
say
against
it
is
certainly
an
hope
that
will
make
this
girl
his
her
for
six
and
then
suddenly
become
by
some
one
would
be
a
wonderful
mean
a
single
word
of
all
you
know
you
life
were
no
one
would
be
than
are
much
better
than
you
pretend
to
reason
we
all
like
to
think
so
well
of
others
is
that
we
are
all
afraid
for
basis
of
optimism
is
sheer
think
that
we
are
generous
because
we
credit
our
neighbour
with
the
possession
of
those
virtues
that
are
likely
to
be
a
benefit
to
praise
the
banker
that
we
may
our
and
find
good
qualities
in
the
in
the
hope
that
he
may
spare
our
mean
everything
that
have
have
the
greatest
contempt
for
for
a
no
life
is
but
one
whose
growth
is
you
want
to
mar
a
you
have
merely
to
reform
for
of
course
that
would
be
but
there
are
other
and
more
interesting
bonds
between
men
and
will
certainly
encourage
have
the
charm
of
being
here
is
will
tell
you
more
than
dear
my
dear
you
must
both
said
the
throwing
off
his
evening
cape
with
its
wings
and
shaking
each
of
his
friends
by
the
hand
in

never
been
so
it
is
really
delightful
things
yet
it
seems
to
me
to
be
the
one
thing

been
looking
for
all

with
excitement

try
what
the
new
here

then
you
will
tell
us
how

with
voices

to
themselves
like

seen
children
upon

from
the

himself
close
to

into

filled
with

down

the
of
the

entered

line
of
boys
carrying
of

and

way
through
the
piles

upon

with
its
windows

its
staring

pure
opal
and
the
roofs
of
the
houses
like
silver
against
some
chimney
opposite
a
thin
of
smoke

a
violet
through
the
the
huge
spoil
of
some
that
hung
from
the
ceiling
of
the
hall

lights

still
burning
from
three
thin
blue
of
flame

rimmed
with
white

thrown
his
hat
and
cape
on
the

through
the
library
towards
the
door
of
his
a
large
chamber
on
the
ground
floor
in
his
feeling
for
he
had
just
had
decorated
for
himself
and
hung
with
some
curious
that
had
been
discovered
stored
in
a
attic
at
he
was
turning
the
handle
of
the
his
eye
fell
upon
the
portrait
had
painted
of

back
as
if
in
he
went
on
into
his
own
looking
somewhat
he
had
taken
the
out
of
his
he
seemed
to
he
came
went
over
to
the
and
examined
the
dim
arrested
light
that
struggled
through
the
silk
the
face
appeared
to
him
to
be
a
little
expression
looked
would
have
said
that
there
was
a
touch
of
cruelty
in
the
was
certainly
turned
round
walking
to
the
drew
up
the
bright
dawn
flooded
the
room
and
swept
the
fantastic
shadows
into
where
they
lay
the
strange
expression
that
he
had
noticed
in
the
face
of
the
portrait
seemed
to
linger
to
be
more
sunlight
showed
him
the
lines
of
cruelty
round
the
mouth
as
clearly
as
if
he
had
been
looking
into
a
mirror
after
he
had
done
some
taking
up
from
the
table
an
oval
glass
framed
in
ivory
one
of
many
presents
to
into
its
polished
line
like
that
his
red
did
it
his
and
came
close
to
the
and
examined
it
were
no
signs
of
any
change
when
he
looked
into
the
actual
and
yet
there
was
no
doubt
that
the
whole
expression
had
was
not
a
mere
fancy
of
his
thing
was
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
began
to
there
across
his
mind
what
he
had
said
in
studio
the
day
the
picture
had
been
he
remembered
it
had
a
mad
wish
that
he
himself
might
remain
and
the
portrait
grow
that
his
own
beauty
might
be
and
the
face
on
the
canvas
bear
the
burden
of
his
passions
and
his
that
the
painted
image
might
be
with
the
lines
of
suffering
and
and
that
he
might
keep
all
the
delicate
bloom
and
of
his
then
just
conscious
his
wish
had
not
been
things
were
seemed
even
to
think
of
there
was
the
picture
before
with
the
touch
of
cruelty
in
the
he
been
was
the
not
had
dreamed
of
her
as
a
great
had
given
his
love
to
her
because
he
had
thought
her
she
had
disappointed
had
been
shallow
and
a
feeling
of
infinite
regret
came
over
as
he
thought
of
her
lying
at
his
feet
like
a
little
remembered
with
what
he
had
watched
had
he
been
made
like
had
such
a
soul
been
given
to
he
had
suffered
the
three
terrible
hours
that
the
play
had
he
had
lived
centuries
of
upon
of
life
was
well

there

sat
down
to

out
for

that
had
made

a
look
of
evil

there

of

in

the

called

at
him
for
a

not

to
any
he
said
with
a
man

he
rose
from

down
on
a
couch
that
stood
facing

an
old
of

wrought
with
a

florid

wondering
if
ever
before
it

concealed
the
secret
of

the

to
do
the

always
with
no
small
he
found
himself
at
first
at
the
portrait
with
a
feeling
of
almost
scientific
such
a
change
should
have
taken
place
was
incredible
to
yet
it
was
a
there
some
subtle
affinity
between
the
chemical
atoms
that
shaped
themselves
into
form
and
colour
on
the
canvas
and
the
soul
that
was
within
it

that
what
that
soul
they
what
it
they
made

there
some
more
terrible
and
felt
going
back
to
the
lay
at
the
picture
in
he
felt
that
it
had
done
for
had
made
him
conscious
how
how
he
had
been
to
was
not
too
late
to
make
reparation
for
could
still
be
his
unreal
and
selfish
love
would
yield
to
some
higher
would
be
transformed
into
some
and
the
portrait
that
had
painted
of
him
would
be
a
guide
to
him
through

be
to
him

the

an
sign
of
the
ruin

brought
upon
their
and

the
rang

double
but
did

trying
to
gather
up
the
scarlet
threads
of
life
and
to
weave
them
into
a
to
find
his
way
through
the
of
passion
through
which
he
was

not
know
what
to
or
what
to

went
over
to
the
table

wrote
a
passionate
letter
to
the

her
forgiveness

happily
in

then
go
on
to
the
and
sup
dramatic
life
had
read
all
this
in
a
think
would
have
wept
over
now
that
it
has
happened
and
to
it
seems
far
too
wonderful
for
is
the
first
passionate
have
ever
written
in
my
that
my
first
passionate
should
have
been
addressed
to
a
dead
they
those
white
silent
people
we
call
the
she
or
or
how
loved
her
seems
years
ago
to
me
was
everything
to
came
that
it
really
only
last
she
played
so
and
my
heart
almost
explained
it
all
to
was
terribly
was
not
moved
a
thought
her
something
happened
that
made
me
tell
you
what
it
but
it
was
said
would
go
back
to
felt
had
done
now
she
is
what
shall
know
the
danger
am
and
there
is
nothing
to
keep
me
would
have
done
that
for
had
no
right
to
kill
was
selfish
of
dear
answered
taking
a
cigarette
from
his
case
and
producing
a
only
way
a
woman
can
ever
reform
a
man
is
by
boring
him
so
completely
that
he
loses
all
possible
interest
in
you
had
married
this
you
would
have
been
you
would
have
treated
her
can
always
be
kind
to
people
about
whom
one
cares
she
would
have
soon
found
out
that
you
were
absolutely
to
when
a
woman
finds
that
out
about
her
she
either
becomes
or
wears
very
smart
that
some
other
husband
has
to
pay
say
nothing
about
the
social
which
would
have
been
of
would
not
have
assure
you
that
in
any
case
the
whole
thing
would
have
been
an
absolute
suppose
it
the
walking
up
and
down
the
room
and
looking
thought
it
was
my
is
not
my
fault
that
this
terrible
tragedy
has
prevented
my
doing
what
was
remember
your
saying
once
that
there
is
a
about
good
they
are
always
made
too
certainly
resolutions
are
useless
attempts
to
interfere
with
scientific
origin
is
pure
result
is
absolutely
give
now
and
some
of
those
luxurious
sterile
emotions
that
have
a
certain
charm
for
the
is
all
that
can
be
said
for
are
simply
cheques
that
men
draw
on
a
bank
where
they
have
no
cried
coming
over
and
sitting
down
beside
is
it
that
feel
this
tragedy
as
much
as
want
think
am
have
done
too
many
foolish
things
during
the
last
to
be
entitled
to
give
yourself
that
answered
with
his
sweet
lad
like
that
he
am
glad
you
think
am
am
nothing
of
the
know
am
yet
must
admit
that
this
thing
that
has
happened
does
not
affect
me
as
it
seems
to
me
to
be
simply
like
a
wonderful
ending
to
a
wonderful
has
all
the
terrible
beauty
of
a
a
tragedy
in
which
took
a
great
but
by
which
have
not
been
is
an
interesting
said
who
found
an
exquisite
pleasure
in
playing
on
the
unconscious
extremely
interesting
fancy
that
the
true
explanation
is
often
happens
that
the
real
of
life
occur
in
such
an
manner
that
they
hurt
us
by
their
crude
their
absolute
their
absurd
want
of
their
entire
lack
of
affect
us
just
as
affects
give
us
an
impression
of
sheer
and
we
revolt
against
a
tragedy
that
possesses
artistic
elements
of
beauty
crosses
our
these
elements
of
beauty
are
the
whole
thing
simply
appeals
to
our
sense
of
dramatic
we
find
that
we
are
no
longer
the
but
the
of
the
rather
we
are
watch
and
the
mere
wonder
of
the
the
present
what
is
it
that
has
really
one
has
killed
herself
for
love
of
wish
that
had
ever
had
such
an
would
have
made
me
in
love
with
love
for
the
rest

people
who
have

there

on
living
long
after

ceased
to

they
to

for

become
stout
and
and
when
meet
they
go
in
at
once
for
awful
memory
of
a

then
things
once
wore
nothing

all
through

as
a
form
of
artistic
mourning
for
a

what

it
was
her
proposing
to
sacrifice
the
whole

with
the
terror
of
you
believe
week
at
found
myself
seated
at
dinner
next
the
lady
in

she
insisted
on
going
over
the
whole
thing
and
digging
up

up

buried
my
romance
in
a
bed
of
dragged
it
out
again
and
assured
me
that
had
her

bound
to
state
that
she
ate
an
enormous
so
did
not
feel
any
what
a

that
it

as
soon

the

they

every
tragedy

they
have
no

more
fortunate
than
assure
that
not
one
of
the
women
have
known
would
have
done
for
me
what
did
for
women
always
console
of
them
do
it
by
going
in
for
trust
a
woman
who
wears
whatever
her
age

a
woman
over
who
is
fond
of

always
means
that
they
have

if
it
were
the
most
fascinating
of

mysteries
have
all
the
charm
of
a
a
woman
once
told
and
can
quite
understand
nothing
makes
one
so
vain
as
being
told
that
one
is
a
makes
of
us
there
is
really
no
end
to
the
that
women
find
in
modern
have
not
mentioned
the
most
important
is
said
the
lad
the
obvious
some
one
when
one
loses
good
society
that
always
a
how
different
must
have
been
from
all
the
women
one
is
something
to
me
quite
beautiful
about
her
am
glad
am
living
in
a
century
when
such
wonders
make
one
believe
in
the
reality
of
the
things
we
all
play
such
as
and
was
terribly
cruel
to
forget
am
afraid
that
women
appreciate
more
than
anything
have
wonderfully
primitive
have
but
they
remain
slaves
looking
for
their
all
the
love
being
am
sure
you
were
have
never
seen
you
really
and
absolutely
but
can
fancy
how
delightful
you
after
you
said
something
to
me
the
day
before
yesterday
that
seemed
to
me
at
the
time
to
be
merely
but
that
see
now
was
absolutely
and
it
holds
the
key
to
was
said
to
me
that
represented
to
you
all
the
of
she
was
one
and
the
that
if
she
died
as
she
came
to
life
as
will
never
come
to
life
again
the
his
face
in
his
she
will
never
come
to
has
played
her
last
you
must
think
of
that
lonely
death
in
the
simply
as
a
strange
fragment
from
some
as
a
wonderful
scene
from
or
or
girl
never
really
and
so
she
has
never
really
you
at
least
she
was
always
a
a
phantom
that
through
plays
and
left
them
for
its
a
reed
through
which
music
sounded
richer
and
more
full
of
moment
she
touched
actual
she
and
it
and
so
she
passed
for
if
you
ashes
on
your
head
because
was
out
against
because
the
daughter
of
waste
your
tears
over
was
less
real
than
they
was
a
evening
in
the
and
with
silver
the
shadows
in
from
the
colours
faded
out
of
some
time
looked
have
explained
me
to
he
with
something
of
a
sigh
of
felt
all
that
you
have
but
somehow
was
afraid
of
and
could
not
express
it
to
well
you
know
we
will
not
talk
again
of
what
has
has
been
a
is
wonder
if
life
has
still
in
store
for
me
anything
as
has
everything
in
store
for
is
nothing
that
with
your
extraordinary
good
will
not
be
able
to
became
and
and
said
rising
to
my
dear
you
would
have
to
fight
for
your
it
they
are
brought
to
you
must
keep
your
good
live
in
an
age
that
reads
too
much
to
be
and
that
thinks
too
much
to
be
spare
now
you
had
better
dress
and
drive
down
to

as

of

by
the

in
a
few
minutes
appeared
with
the
lamps
and
drew

blinds

for

to

seemed
to
take
an
time
over
soon
as
he
had
he
rushed
to
the
screen
and
drew
it
there
was
no
further
change
in
the
had
received
the
news
of
death
before
he
had
known
of
it
was
conscious
of
the
events
of
life
as
they
vicious
cruelty
that
the
fine
lines
of
the
mouth
no
appeared
at
the
very
moment
that
the
girl
had
drunk
the
whatever
it
was
it
to
it
merely
take
of
what
passed
within
the
and
hoped
that
some
day
he
would
see
the
change
taking
place
before
his
very
as
he
hoped
a
romance
it
had

touched

and
taken
her
with

she
played

she
she
had
died
for
love
of

love
would
always
be
a
sacrament
to
him

for
everything
by
the
sacrifice
she
had
made
of
her
would
not
think
any
more
of
what
she
had
made
him
go
on
that
horrible
night
at
the
he
thought
of
it
would
be
as
a
wonderful
tragic
figure

on
to
the
stage
to
show
the
supreme
reality
of
wonderful

to
his
eyes
as
he
remembered
her
and
and
shy
brushed
them
away
and
looked
again
at
the

that
the
time
had
really
come
for
making
his

his
choice
already
been

had
decided
that

infinite
curiosity
about
infinite
pleasures

and
wild
joys

wilder

to
have
all
these

to
bear
the
burden
of
his

was
feeling
of
pain
over
him
as
he
thought
of
the
that
was
in

for
the
fair
face
on
the
in
of

had
or
to
those
painted
lips
that
now
smiled
so
at
after
morning
he
had
sat
before
the
portrait
wondering
at
its
almost
of
as
it
seemed
to
him
at
it
to
alter
now
with
every
mood
to
which
he

to
become
a
and
to
be
hidden
away
in
a
locked
to
be
shut
out
from
the
sunlight
that
had
so
often
touched
to
brighter
gold
the
wonder
of
its
pity
of
the
pity
of
a
he
thought
of
praying
that
the
horrible
sympathy
that
existed
between
him
and
the
picture
might
had
changed
in
answer
to
a
perhaps
in
answer
to
a
prayer
it
might
remain
that
knew
anything
about

surrender
the
chance
of
remaining
always
however
fantastic
that
chance

with
what
consequences
it

a
real
pleasure
in
watching

him
the
most
magical
of

if

probably
merely
a

shook
his
and
a
look

have
you
pulled
the

the
best
thing
have
ever
take
the
screen

simply
of
your
servant
hiding
my
work
like

the
room
looked
different

nothing
to

an
place
for
me

walked
towards
the
corner
of
the
cry
of
terror
broke
from
and
he
rushed
between
the
painter
and
the
he
looking
very
must
not
look
at
wish
you
look
at
my
own
are
not

and
the
pupils
of
his
eyes
were
like
disks
of
blue
was
all
what
is
the
course
look
at
it
if
you
want
me
he
rather
turning
on
his
heel
and
going
over
towards

rather
absurd

going
to
exhibit
it
in

probably
have
to
give
it
another
coat
of
before
so
must
see
it
some
and
why
not
exhibit

to
exhibit
a
strange
sense

it
always
behind
a
you
care
much
about
passed
his
hand
over
his
were
beads
of
felt
that
he
was
on
the
of
a
horrible
told
me
a
month
ago
that
you
would
never
exhibit
he
have
you
changed
your
people
who
go
in
for
being
consistent
have
just
as
many
as
others
only
difference
is
that
your
are
rather
have
forgotten
that
you
assured
me
most
that
nothing
in
the
world
would
induce
you
to
send
it
to
any
told
exactly
the
same
stopped
and
a
of
light
came
into
his
remembered
that
had
said
to
him
half
seriously
and
half
in
you
want
to
have
a
strange
quarter
of
an

to
tell
you
why
he
exhibit
your

me
why
he
and
it
was
a
revelation
to
perhaps
had
his
would
ask
him
and
he
coming
over
quite
close
and
looking
him
straight
in
the
have
each
of
us
a
me
know
and
shall
tell
you
was
your
reason
for
refusing
to
exhibit
my
painter
in
spite
of
if
told
you
might
like
me
less
than
you
and
you
would
certainly
laugh
at
could
not
bear
your
doing
either
of
those
two
you
wish
me
never
to
look
at
your
picture
am
have
always
you
to
look
you
wish
the
best
work
have
ever
done
to
be
hidden
from
the
am
friendship
is
to
me
than
any
fame
or
you
must
tell
insisted
think
have
a
right
to
feeling
of
terror
had
passed
and
curiosity
had
taken
its
was
determined
to
find
out
us
sit
said
the
looking
us
sit
just
answer
me
one
you
noticed
in
the
picture
something
that
probably
at
first
did
not
strike
but
that
revealed
itself
to
you
cried
the
the
arms
of
his
chair
with
hands
and
at
him
with
wild
see
you
till
you
hear
what
have
to
from
the
moment
met
your
personality
had
the
most
extraordinary
influence
over
was
and
by
became
to
me
the
visible
of
that
unseen
ideal
whose
memory
us
artists
like
an
exquisite
grew
jealous
of
every
one
to
whom
you
wanted
to
have
you
all
to
was
only
happy
when
was
with
you
were
away
from
you
were
still
present
in
my
never
let
you
know
anything
about
would
have
been
would
not
have
understood
hardly
understood
it
only
knew
that
had
seen
perfection
face
to
and
that
the
world
had
become
wonderful
to
my
for
in
such
mad
there
is
the
of
losing
no
less
than
the
of
keeping
and
weeks
went
and
grew
more
and
more
absorbed
in
came
a
new
had
drawn
you
as
in
and
as
with
and
polished
with
heavy
you
had
sat
on
the
of
across
the
green
had
leaned
over
the
still
pool
of
some
woodland
and
seen
in
the
silent
silver
the
marvel
of
your
own
it
had
all
been
what
art
should
and
a
fatal
day
sometimes
determined
to
paint
a
wonderful
portrait
of
you
as
you
actually
not
in
the
costume
of
dead
but
in
your
own
dress
and
in
your
own
it
was
the
realism
of
the
or
the
mere
wonder
of
your
own
thus
directly
presented
to
me
without
mist
or
know
that
as
worked
at
every
and
film
of
colour
seemed
to
me
to
reveal
my
grew
afraid
that
others
would
know
of
my
that
had
told
too
that
had
put
too
much
of
myself
into
it
was
that
resolved
never
to
allow
the
picture
to
be
were
a
little
but
then
you
did
not
realize
all
that
it
meant
to
to
whom
talked
about
laughed
at
did
not
mind
the
picture
was
and
sat
alone
with
felt
that
was
after
a
few
days
the
thing
left
my
and
as
soon
as
had
got
rid
of
the
of
its
it
seemed
to
me
that
had
been
foolish
in
that
had
seen
anything
in
more
than
that
you
were
extremely
and
that
could
now
help
feeling
that
it
is
a
mistake
to
think
that
the
passion
one
feels
in
creation
is
ever
really
shown
in
the
work
one
is
always
more
abstract
than
we
and
colour
tell
us
of
form
and
is
often
seems
to
me
that
art
the
artist
far
more
completely
than
it
ever
reveals
so
when
got
this
offer
from
determined
to
make
your
portrait
the
principal
thing
in
my
never
occurred
to
me
that
you
would
see
now
that
you
were
picture
be
must
not
be
angry
with
for
what
have
told
said
to
you
are
made
to
be
drew
a
long
colour
came
back
to
his
and
a
smile
played
about
his
was
was
safe
for
the
he
could
not
help
feeling
infinite
pity
for
the
painter
who
had
just
made
this
strange
confession
to
and
wondered
if
he
himself
would
ever
be
so
dominated
by
the
personality
of
a
had
the
charm
of
being
very
that
was
was
too
clever
and
too
to
be
really
fond
there
ever
be
some
one
who
would
fill
him
with
a
strange
that
one
of
the
things
that
life
had
in
is
extraordinary
to
said
you
should
have
seen
this
in
the
you
really
see
saw
something
in
he
that
seemed
to
me
very
you
mind
my
looking
at
the
thing
shook
his
must
not
ask
me
could
not
possibly
let
you
stand
in
front
of
that
will
some
perhaps
you
are
now
have
been
the
one
person
in
my
life
who
has
really
influenced
my
have
done
that
is
owe
to
you
know
what
it
cost
me
to
tell
you
all
that
have
told
dear
said
have
you
told
that
you
felt
that
you
me
too
is
not
even
a
was
not
intended
as
a
was
a
that
have
made
something
seems
to
have
gone
out
of
one
should
never
put
worship
into
was
a
very
disappointing
what
did
you
see
anything
else
in
the
did
was
nothing
else
to
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
you
you
talk
about
is
and
are
and
we
must
always
remain
have
got
said
the
painter
cried
the
with
a
of
spends
his
days
in
saying
what
is
incredible
and
his
evenings
in
doing
what
is
the
sort
of
life
would
like
to
still
think
would
go
to
if
were
in
would
sooner
go
to
will
sit
to
me
spoil
my
life
as
an
artist
by
man
comes
across
two
ideal
come
across
explain
it
to
but
must
never
sit
to
you
is
something
fatal
about
a
has
a
life
of
its
will
come
and
have
tea
with
will
be
just
as
for
am
now
am
sorry
you
let
me
look
at
the
picture
once
that
be
quite
understand
what
you
feel
about
he
left
the
smiled
to
little
he
knew
of
the
true
how
strange
it
was
instead
of
having
been
forced
to
reveal
his
own
he
had
almost
by
in
a
secret
from
his
much
that
strange
confession
explained
to
absurd
fits
of
his
wild
his
his
curious
understood
them
all
and
he
felt
seemed
to
him
to
be
something
tragic
in
a
friendship
so
coloured
by
and
touched
the
portrait

be
hidden
away
at
all
could
not
run
such
a
risk
of
discovery
had
been
mad
of
him
to
have
allowed
the
thing
to
even
for
an
in
a
room
to
which
any
of
his
friends
had
his
servant

looked
at
him
and
wondered
if
he
had

of
behind

man

quite
and
waited
for
his
lit
a
cigarette
and
walked
over
to
the
glass
and
into
could
see
the
reflection
of
face
was
like
a
mask
of

nothing
to
be
afraid
he
thought
it
best
to
be
on
his
very
he
told
him
to
tell
the
that
he
wanted
to
see
and
then
to
go
to
the
and
ask
him
to
send
two
of
his
men

told
her
to
manage
things
as
she
thought

put
the

in

pocket
and
looked
round
the
eye
fell
on
a
purple
satin
heavily
embroidered
with
a
splendid
piece
of
late
work
that
his
grandfather
had
found
in
a
convent
near
that
would
serve
to
wrap
the
thing
had
perhaps
served
often
as
a
pall
for
the
it
was
to
hide
something
that
had
a
corruption
of
its
worse
than
the
corruption
of
death

for
a
moment
he
that
he
had
not
told
the
true
reason
why
he
had
wished
to
hide
the
picture
would
have
helped
him
to
resist
and
the
still
more
influences
that
came
from
his
own
love
that
he
bore
it
was
really
nothing
in
it
that
was
not
noble
and
was
not
that
mere
physical
of
beauty
that
is
born
of
the
senses
and
that
dies
when

such

up
from
the
couch
the
great
texture
that
covered
holding
it
in
his
passed
behind
the
the
face
on
the
canvas
than
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
and
yet
his
of
it
was
blue
and
all
were
was
simply
the
expression
that
had
was
horrible
in
its
to
what
he
saw
in
it
of
censure
or
how
shallow
about
had
and
of
what
little
own
soul
was
looking
out
at
him
from
the
canvas
and
calling
him
to
look
of
pain

across
and
he
the
rich
pall

he
did

knock

to
the
passed

not

to
know
where
the

taken

something
sly
about

he
had
down
at
the
he
a
note
to
asking
him
to
send
him
round
something
to
read
and
him
that
they
were
to
meet
at
that
for
an

to
show
the

in
two
or
three
minutes

the

in
with

somewhat
young

a

the
of
most
of
the
artists
who
dealt
with

for
people
to

always
made
an
exception
in
favour

something
about
that
charmed
was
a
pleasure
even
to
see
can
do
for
he
rubbing
his
fat
thought
would
do
myself
the
honour
of
coming
round
in
have
just
got
a
beauty
of
a
it
up
at
a
from
suited
for
a
religious
am
so
sorry
you
have
given
yourself
the
trouble
of
coming
shall
certainly
drop
in
and
look
at
the
go
in
much
at
present
for
religious
only
want
a
picture
carried
to
the
top
of
the
house
for
is
rather
so
thought
would
ask
you
to
lend
me
a
couple
of
your
trouble
at
am
delighted
to
be
of
any
service
to
is
the
work
of
replied
moving
the
screen
you
move
covering
and
just
as
it
want
it
to
get
going
will
be
no
said
the
with
the
aid
of
his
to
the
picture
from
the
long
brass
chains
by
which
it
was
where
shall
we
carry
it
will
show
you
the
if
you
will
kindly
follow
perhaps
you
had
better
go
in
am
afraid
it
is
right
at
the
top
of
the
will
go
up
by
the
front
as
it
is
held
the
door
open
for
and
they
passed
out
into
the
hall
and
began
the
elaborate
character
of
the
frame
had
made
the
picture
extremely
and
now
and
in
spite
of
the
protests
of
who
had
the
true
spirited
dislike
of
seeing
a
gentleman
doing
anything
put
his
hand
to
it
so
as
to
help
of
a
load
to
the
little
man
when
they
reached
the
top
he
his
shiny
am
afraid
it
is
rather
as
he
unlocked
the
door
that
opened
into
the
room
that
was
to
keep
for
him
the
curious
secret
of
his
life
and
hide
his
soul
from
the
eyes
of

not
entered
the
place
for
more
than
four
since
he
had

it
first
as
a

he
was
a

then
as
a
study

he
grew
somewhat

a

had
been
specially
built
by
the
last
for
the
use
of
the
little

his
strange

also
for
other

had
always
hated
and
desired
to
keep
at
a

to
to
have
but
little

the
huge
with
its
painted
panels
and
its
in
which
he
had
so
often
hidden
himself
as
a
the
filled
with
his
the
wall
behind
it
was
hanging
the
same
ragged
tapestry
where
a
faded
king
and
queen
were
playing
chess
in
a
while
a
company
of
rode
carrying
hooded
birds
on
their
well
he
remembered
it
moment
of
his
lonely
childhood
came
back
to
him
as
he
looked
recalled
the
stainless
purity
of
his
and
it
seemed
horrible
to
him
that
it
was
here
the
fatal
portrait
was
to
be
hidden
little
he
had
in
those
dead
of
all
that
was
in
store
for
there
was
no
other
place
in
the
house
so
secure
from
eyes
as
had
the
and
no
one
else
could
enter

on

canvas

he
watch
the
corruption

not
his
nature
grow
after
was
no
reason
that
the
future
should
be
so
full
of
love
might
come
across
his
and
and
shield
him
from
those
sins
that
seemed
to
be
already
stirring
in
spirit
and
in
curious
sins
whose
very
mystery
lent
them
their
and
their
some
the
cruel
look
would
have
passed
away
from
the
scarlet
sensitive
and
he
might
show
to
the
world
that
was
by
and

be
foolish

as
the
of
old
men
would
be
the
the
the
twisted
that
he
remembered
in
the
grandfather
who
had
been
so
stern
to
him

his
picture

no

the
secret
of
his
trouble

days
to

slowly
towards

as
he
did

as
he
got
behind
he
seized
it
and
turned
in
his
chair
as
if
he
was
going
to

at
him
and
dug
the
knife
into
the
great
vein
that
is
behind

down
on

a
few
seconds
he
stood
bending
over

down
into
the
black
well
of

took
out

rounds

lantern
on

silent
crimson
spot

all
his
misery

he
walked
up

down

biting
his

and
he
took
down
the
from
one
of
the
shelves
and
began
to
turn
over
the
that
was
the

nine
the
next
morning
his
servant
came
in
with
a
cup
of

on

to
touch
him
twice
on

before
he
and
as
he
opened
his
eyes
a
faint
smile
passed
across
his
as
though
he
had
been
lost
in
some
delightful
he
had
not
dreamed
at

to
sip

sun
came
streaming
into
the
sky

and
there
was
a
warmth
in
the
was
almost
like
a
morning
in
the
events
of
the
preceding
night
with
feet
into
his
brain
and
themselves
there
with
terrible
at
the
memory
of
all
that
he
had
and
for
a
moment
the
same
curious
feeling
of
for
that
had
made
him
kill
him
as
he
sat
in
the
chair
came
back
to
and
he
grew
cold
with
dead
man
was
still
sitting
and
in
the
sunlight
horrible
that
things
were
for
the
not
for
the

that
if
he
on
what
he
had
gone
through
he
would
or
grow
were
sins
whose
was
more
in
the
memory
than
in
the
doing

strange
that
the
pride
more
than
the
and

to
the
intellect
a
sense

greater
than

a
thing
to
be
driven
out
of
the
to
be
with
to
be
lest
it
might
one
the
he
passed
his
hand
across
his
and
then
got
up
and
dressed
himself
with
even
more
than
his
usual
giving
a
good
deal
of
attention
to
the
choice
of
his
and
and
changing
his
rings
more
than
spent
a
long
time
also
over
tasting
the
various
talking
to
his
valet
about
some
new
liveries
that
he
was
thinking
of
getting
made
for
the
servants
at

going
through

some
of
the

read
several
times
over

then
tore
up
with
a
slight
look

upon

remarked
that
every

he

to
have
a
fantastic
to

over
to

took
out

that
he

not

about
what

played
both
the

after

to

almost
to
dislike

absorbed
in

that
he

no

to
this

he
seemed
to
become
more
interested

his

appeared
once

twice
in
some
of
the
scientific
reviews

down

the
edge
of
some
black

the

rather
his

you
for

you
said
it

of
life

spoke
with
slow
was
a
look
of
contempt
in
the
steady
searching
gaze
that
he
turned
on
kept
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
and
seemed
not
to
have
noticed
the
gesture
with
which
he
had
been
it
is
a
matter
of
life
and
and
to
more
than
one
took
a
chair
by
the
and
sat
opposite
to
two
eyes
there
was
infinite
knew
that
what
he
was
going
to
do
was
a
strained
moment
of
he
leaned
across
and
very
but
watching
the
effect
of
each
word
upon
the
face
of
him
he
had
sent
in
a
locked
room
at
the
top
of
this
a
room
to
which
nobody
but
myself
has
a
dead
man
is
seated
at
a
has
been
dead
ten
hours
and
look
at
me
like
the

how
he
are
matters
that

the
one
man
who
is

bring
you
into
the
have
no
you
are

about
chemistry
and
things
of
that
have
made
you
have
got
to
do
is
to
destroy
the
thing
that
is
destroy
it
so
that
not
a
of
it
will
be
saw
this
person
come
into
the
at
the
present
moment
he
is
supposed
to
be
in
will
not
be
missed
for
he
is
there
must

it
to
me
what
work
you

glad
of
who
drove
him
to
should
you
still
refuse
to
do
this
for

will
have
absolutely
nothing

to
see
you
publicly
dare
you
ask

up
in
this
should
have
thought
you
knew
more
about
friend
have
taught
you
much
about
whatever
else
he

to
some
of
your
come
to
it
was
killed
know
what
he

made
me
my
life
he
had
more
to
do
with
the
making
or
the
of
it
than
poor
has
may
not
have
intended
the
result
was
the
is
that
what
you
have
come
shall
not
inform
upon
is
not
my
without
my
stirring
in
the
you
are
certain
to
be
ever
commits
a
crime
without
doing
something
will
have
nothing
to

with
must
have
something
to
do
with
wait
a
listen
to
ask
of
you
is
to
perform
a
certain
scientific
go
to
hospitals
and
and
the
that
you
do
there
affect
in
some
or
laboratory
you
found
this
man
lying
on
a
table
with
red
out
in
it
for
the
blood
to
flow
you
would
simply
look
upon
him
as
an

not
turn
a
would
not
believe
that
you
were
doing
anything
the
you
would
probably
feel
that
you
were
the
human

increasing
the
sum
of
knowledge
in
the
or
intellectual
or
something
of
that
want
you
to
do

merely
what
you
have
often
done
to
destroy
a
body
must
be
far
less
horrible
than
what
you
are
accustomed
to
work
it

the
only
piece
of
evidence
against
it
is
am

it
is

to
be
discovered
unless
you
help
have
no

help
forget
am
simply
to
the
whole
has
nothing
to
do
with
of
the
position
am
before
you
came
almost
with
may
know
terror
yourself
some
think
of
at
the
matter
purely
from
the
scientific
point
of
inquire
where
the
dead
things
on
which
you
experiment
come
inquire
have
told
you
too
much
as
it
beg
of
you
to
do
were
friends
speak
about
those

dead
linger
man
upstairs

sitting
at
the
table
with
head
and
you
come
to
my
am
they
will
hang
you
will
hang
me
for
what
have
is
no
good
in
this
absolutely
refuse
to
do
anything
in
the
is
insane
of
you
to
ask
is
same
look
of
pity
came
into
he
stretched
out
his
took
a
piece
of
and
wrote
something
on
read
it
over
folded
it
and
pushed
it
across
the

he
got
up
and
went
over
to
the
looked
at
him
in

then
took
up
the
and
opened
he
read
his
face
became
pale
and
he
fell
back
in
his
horrible
sense
of
sickness
came
over
felt
as
if
his
heart
was
beating
itself
to
death
in
some
empty
two
or
three
minutes
of
terrible
turned
round
and
came
and
stood
behind
putting
his
hand
upon
his
am
so
sorry
for
he
you
leave
me
no
have
a
letter
written
it
see
the
you
help
must
send
you
help
will
send
know
what
the
result
will
you
are
going
to
help
is
impossible
for
you
to
refuse
tried
to
spare
will
do
me
the
justice
to
admit
were
treated
me
as
no
man
has
ever
to
treat
living
at
any
bore
it
it
is
for
me
to
buried
his
face
in
his
and
a
passed
through
it
is
my
turn
to
know
what
they
thing
is
quite
work
yourself
into
this
thing
has
to
be
and
do
broke
from

and
he
all
ticking
of
the
clock
on
the

to
him
to
be
dividing
time
into
separate
atoms
of
each
of
which
was
too
terrible
to
be
felt
as
if
an
iron
ring
was
being
slowly
round
his
as
if
the
with
which
he
was
threatened
had
already
come
upon

upon
his
shoulder
weighed
like
a
hand
of

addressed
an

the

he
rang
the

and
gave
it
to

to
bring

twenty
neither

the

the
beat
of
a

looking
at

in

away
as

spoke
and
stood
looking
out
at
the

no
about
ten
minutes
a
knock
came
to
the
and
the
servant
carrying
a
large
mahogany
chest
of
with
a
long
coil
of
steel
and
platinum
wire
and
two
rather
shaped

you

your

in

calm
presence
of
a

to
give
him
extraordinary

bit
his

take
about
five
he
will
be

if
you
are
back
at
just
leave
my
things
out
for

have
the
evening
to

at
so
shall
not

the
leaving

there
is
not
a

take
it
for
bring
the

spoke
rapidly
and
in
an
authoritative
felt
dominated
by
left
the
room
they
reached
the
top
took
out
the
key
and
turned
it
in
the
he
and
a
troubled
look
came
into
his
think
can
go
he
is
nothing
to
require
said
half
opened
the
he
did
he
saw
the
face
of
his
portrait
in
the
the
floor
in
front
of
it
the
torn
curtain
was
remembered
that
the
night
before
he
had
for
the
first
time
in
his
to
hide
the
fatal
and
was
about
to
rush
when
he
drew
back
with
a
was
that
red
dew
that
wet
and
on
one
of
the
as
though
the
canvas
had
horrible
it
it
seemed
to
him
for
the
than
the
silent
thing
that
he
knew
was
stretched
across
the
the
thing
whose
shadow
on
the
spotted
carpet
showed
him
that
it
had
not
but
was
still
as
he
had
left
a
deep
opened
the
door
a
little
and
with
eyes
and
walked
quickly
determined
that
he
would
not
look
even
once
upon
the
dead
down
and
taking
up
the
he
it
right
over
the
he
feeling
afraid
to
turn
and
his
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
the
of
the
pattern
before
heard
bringing
in
the
heavy
and
the
and
the
other
things
that
he
had
required
for
his
began
to
wonder
if
he
and
had
ever
if
what
they
had
thought
of
each
me
said
a
stern
voice
behind
turned
and
just
conscious
that
the
dead
man
had
been
thrust
back
into
the
chair
and
that
was
into
a
yellow
he
was
going
he
heard
the
key
being
turned
in
the
was
long
after
seven
when
came
back
into
the
was
but
absolutely
have
done
what
you
asked
me
to
he
us
never
see
each
other
have
saved
me
from
forget
said
soon
as
had
he
went
was
a
horrible
smell
of
acid
in
the
the
thing
that
had
been
sitting
at
the
table
was
at
dressed
and
wearing
a
large
of
was
into
by
forehead
was
with
and
he
felt
but
his
manner
as
he
bent
over
his
hand
was
as
easy
and
graceful
as
one
never
seems
so
much
at
ease
as
when
one
has
to
play
a
no
one
looking
at
that
night
could
have
believed
that
he
had
passed
through
a
tragedy
as
horrible
as
any
tragedy
of
our
finely
shaped
fingers
could
never
have
a
knife
for
nor
those
smiling
lips
have
cried
out
on
and
himself
could
not
help
wondering
at
the
calm
of
his
and
for
a
moment
felt
the
terrible
pleasure
of
a
double
was
a
small
got
up
rather
in
a
hurry
by
who
was
a
very
clever
woman
with
what
used
to
describe
as
the
remains
of
really
remarkable
had
proved
an
excellent
wife
to
one
of
our
most
and
having
buried
her
husband
properly
in
a
marble
which
she
had
herself
and
married
off
her
daughters
to
some
rather
elderly
she
devoted
herself
now
to
the
pleasures
of
and
when
she
could
get
was
one
of
her
especial
and
she
always
told
him
that
she
was
extremely
glad
she
had
not
met
him
in
early
my
should
have
fallen
in
love
with
she
used
to
thrown
my
right
over
the
mills
for
your
is
most
fortunate
that
you
were
not
thought
of
at
the
it
our
were
so
and
the
mills
were
so
occupied
in
trying
to
raise
the
that
never
had
even
a
with
that
was
all
was
and
there
is
no
pleasure
in
taking
in
a
husband
who
never
sees
guests
this
evening
were
rather
fact
as
she
explained
to
behind
a
very
one
of
her
married
daughters
had
come
up
quite
suddenly
to
stay
with
to
make
matters
had
actually
brought
her
husband
with
think
it
is
most
of
my
she
course
go
and
stay
with
them
every
summer
after
come
from
but
then
an
old
woman
like
me
must
have
fresh
air
and
really
wake
them
know
what
an
existence
they
lead
down
is
pure
country
get
up
because
they
have
so
much
to
and
go
to
bed
because
they
have
so
little
to
think
has
not
been
a
scandal
in
the
neighbourhood
since
the
time
of
and
consequently
they
all
fall
asleep
after
sit
next
either
of
shall
sit
by
me
and
amuse
a
graceful
compliment
and
looked
round
the
it
was
certainly
a
of
the
people
he
had
never
seen
and
the
others
consisted
of
one
of
those
so
common
in
clubs
who
have
no
but
are
thoroughly
by
their
an
woman
of
with
a
hooked
who
was
always
trying
to
get
herself
but
was
so
plain
that
to
her
great
disappointment
no
one
would
ever
believe
anything
against
a
pushing
with
a
delightful
lisp
and
his
a
dull
with
one
of
those
characteristic
faces
once
are
never
and
her
a
creature
like
so

copper
he
his
hands
and
forehead
with
a
cool

grew
and
he
at
his
two
of
the
windows
stood
a
large
made
out
of
ebony

with
ivory
and
blue
watched
it
as
though
it
were
a
thing
that

it
held
something
that
he
longed
for

almost
breath
mad

a
cigarette
and
then
threw

lashes
almost
touched

box
of

crystals

a
green
in

for
some
with
a
smile
upon
his
though
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
was
terribly
he
drew
himself
up
and
at
the

twenty
minutes
to

drove
rapidly
towards
the
cold

to
and
the
looked
in

just
and
dim

of

the
sound

horrible
and
back
in

his
hat
pulled
over

with
eyes
the
shame
of
the
great

the
madness
of
sins
that

low
in

a
yellow
time
to

a
huge
cloud
stretched
a
long
arm
across
and
hid
grew
and
the
streets
more
narrow
and
the

lost
his
way
and
had
to

that
there
was
no

though
forgiveness
was

he
was
determined
to
to

crush

would
crush

adder
that

his
delicate
hands
struck
at

the
man
was

seemed
and
the
streets
like
the
black
web
of
some
became
and
as
the
mist
he
felt
they
passed
by
lonely
fog
was
lighter
and
he
could
see
the
with
their
of
dog
as
they
went
and
far
away
in
the
darkness

wandering
horse
in

broke
into
a
some
time
they
left

again
over

those
subtle
words
that
dealt
with

till
he
had
found
in
them
the
full

it
of
his
and
by
intellectual
passions
that
without
such
justification
would
still
have
dominated
his
cell
to
cell
of
his
brain

one
and
the
wild
desire

terrible
of
all

that
had
once
been

him
because
it
made

dear
to
him
now
for
that
very
was
the
one
coarse

the
crude
violence
of
the
very
of
thief
and
were
more
in
their
intense
of

having
got
out
and
given
the

the
extra
fare

now
and
then
a
thrill
of
terror
ran
through
him

pressed
against

of
the
like
a

he
had
seen
the
face
of

only
his
fancy
that

called
vengeance
out
of

night

set
the
shapes
of

grew

him

the
third
day
that

to

something
in
the

back
now
on

something
of

with

an
hour

little
crimson
pyramid
of
through
a
white
sugar
upon
can
tell
is
not
a
story
could
tell
to
any
one
sounds
but
you
understand
what
was
quite
beautiful
and
wonderfully
like
think
it
was
that
which
first
attracted
me
to
remember
long
ago
that
was
not
one
of
our
own
of
was
simply
a
girl
in
a
really
loved
am
quite
sure
that
loved
during
this
wonderful
that
we
have
been
used
to
run
down
and
see
her
two
or
three
times
a
she
met
me
in
a
little
kept
down
on
her
and
she
was
were
to
have
gone
away
together
this
morning
at
determined
to
leave
her
as
as
had
found
should
think
the
novelty
of
the
emotion
must
have
given
you
a
thrill
of
real
interrupted
can
finish
your
for
gave
her
good
advice
and
broke
her
was
the
beginning
of
your
you
are
say
these
heart
is
not
she
cried
and
all
there
is
no
upon
can
like
in
her
garden
of
mint
and
weep
over
a
said
as
he
leaned
back
in
his
dear
you
have
the
most
you
think
this
girl
will
ever
be
really
content
now
with
any
one
of
her
own
suppose
she
will
be
married
some
day
to
a
rough
carter
or
a
the
fact
of
having
met
and
loved
will
teach
her
to
her
and
she
will
be
a
moral
point
of
say
that
think
much
of
your
great
as
a
it
is
how
do
you
know
that
floating
at
the
present
moment
in
some
with
lovely
round
like
bear
mock
at
and
then
suggest
the
most
serious
am
sorry
told
you
care
what
you
say
to
know
was
right
in
acting
as
rode
past
the
farm
this
saw
her
white
face
at
the
like
a
spray
of
let
us
talk
about
it
any
and
try
to
persuade
me
that
the
first
good
action
have
done
for
the
first
little
bit
of
have
ever
is
really
a
sort
of
want
to
be
am
going
to
be
me
something
about
is
going
on
in
have
not
been
to
the
club
for
people
are
still
discussing
poor
should
have
thought
they
had
got
tired
of
that
by
this
said
pouring
himself
out
some
wine
and
dear
they
have
only
been
talking
about
it
for
six
and
the
public
are
really
not
equal
to
the
mental
strain
of
having
more
than
one
topic
every
three
have
been
very
fortunate
have
had
my
own
and
they
have
got
the
mysterious
of
an
still
insists
that
the
man
in
the
grey
ulster
who
left
for
by
the
midnight
train
on
the
ninth
of
was
poor
and
the
police
declare
that
never
arrived
in
at
suppose
in
about
a
we
shall
be
told
that
he
has
been
seen
in
is
an
odd
but
every
one
who
is
said
to
be
seen
at
must
be
a
delightful
and
possess
all
the
attractions
of
the
next
do
you
think
has
happened
to
asked
holding
up
his
against
the
light
and
wondering
how
it
was
that
he
could
discuss
the
matter
so
have
not
the
chooses
to
hide
it
is
no
business
of
he
is
want
to
think
about
is
the
only
thing
that
ever
hate
said
the
younger
man
said
passing
beneath
his
the
of
an
open
can
survive
everything
nowadays
except
and
are
the
only
two
facts
in
the
nineteenth
century
that
one
explain
us
have
our
coffee
in
the
must
play
to
man
with
whom
my
wife
ran
away
played
was
very
fond
of
house
is
rather
lonely
without
married
life
is
merely
a
a
bad
then
one
the
loss
even
of
worst
one
them
the
are
such
an
essential
part
of
said
but
rose
from
the
and
passing
into
the
next
sat
down
to
the
piano
and
let
his
fingers
stray
across
the
white
and
black
ivory
of
the
the
coffee
had
been
brought
he
and
looking
over
at
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
that
was
was
very
and
always
wore
a
should
he
have
been
was
not
clever
enough
to
have
he
had
a
wonderful
genius
for
a
man
can
paint
like
and
yet
be
as
dull
as
was
really
rather
only
interested
me
and
that
was
when
he
told
years
that
he
had
a
wild
for
you
and
that
you
were
the
dominant
motive
of
his
was
very
fond
of
said
with
a
note
of
sadness
in
his
people
say
that
he
was
some
of
the
papers
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
at
all
know
there
are
places
in
but
was
not
the
sort
of
man
to
have
gone
to
had
no
was
his
chief
would
you
if
told
you
that
had
murdered
said
the
younger
watched
him
after
he
had
would
my
dear
that
you
were
posing
for
a
character
that
suit
crime
is
just
as
all
is
is
not
in
to
commit
a
am
sorry
if
hurt
your
vanity
by
saying
but
assure
you
it
is
belongs
exclusively
to
the
lower
blame
them
in
the
smallest
should
fancy
that
crime
was
to
them
what
art
is
to
simply
a
method
of
extraordinary
method
of
you
that
a
man
who
has
once
committed
a
murder
could
possibly
do
the
same
crime
tell
me
anything
becomes
a
pleasure
if
one
does
it
too
cried
is
one
of
the
most
important
secrets
of
should
that
murder
is
always
a
should
never
do
anything
that
one
talk
about
after
let
us
pass
from
poor
wish
could
believe
that
he
had
come
to
such
a
really
romantic
end
as
you
but
dare
say
he
fell
into
the
off
an

on
his
back

with
the
heavy
floating
over
him

long

you
think
he
would
have
done
much
more
good
the
last
ten
years
his
painting
had
gone
off
very
a
and
across
the
room
and
began
to
stroke
the
head
of
a
curious
a
bird
with
pink
crest
and
that
was
balancing
itself
upon
a
bamboo
his
pointed
fingers
touched
it
dropped
the
white
of
lids
over
eyes
and
began
to
backwards
and
he
turning
round
and
taking
his
out

quite
gone

to
me
to
have

the
what
has
become
of
that
wonderful
portrait
he
did
of

since
he
finished

your
telling
me
years
ago
that
you
had
sent
it
down
to
and
that
it
had
got
or
stolen
on
the
never
got
it
a
it
was
really
a
remember
wanted
to
buy
wish
had
belonged
to
best
his
work
was
that
curious
mixture
of
bad
painting
and
good
intentions
that
always
a
man
to
be
called
a
representative
you
advertise
for
said
suppose
never
really
liked

sorry

for
memory
of
the
thing

to
do
you
talk
of

to
remind
me
of
those
curious
lines
in
some

what
it
was

sinking
into

his
head
and
struck
some
soft
chords
on
the
the
painting
of
a

face
without
a
elder

lay
back
and
looked
at
him

a
little
crowd
of
people
listening

some
passed

the

question

me
as
being

is
very
rich
in
curious
effects

a
ring
of
white

under
a
broken
roof
of

a
wonderful
phrase
into

really
very
good
in

quite
a
thought
of
telling
the

with
a
line
from
a
forgotten
poem

come
across
a
from
a
piece
of
music
that
you
had
ceased
to
tell
that
it

these
that
our

writes
about
that

something
more
to

and
went
was
a
lovely
so
warm
that
he
threw
his
coat
over
his
arm
and
did
not
even
put
his
silk
scarf
round
his
he
smoking
his
two
young
men
in
evening
dress
passed
heard
one
of
them
whisper
to
the
is
remembered
how
pleased
he
used
to
be
when
he
was
pointed
or
stared
or
talked
was
tired
of
hearing
his
own
name
the
charm
of
the
little
village
where
he
had
been
so
often
lately
was
that
no
one
knew
who
he
had
often
told
the
girl
whom
he
had
to
love
him
that
he
was
and
she
had
believed
had
told
her
once
that
he
was
and
she
had
laughed
at
him
and
answered
that
wicked
people
were
always
very
old
and
very
a
laugh
she
like
a
how
pretty
she
had
been
in
her
cotton
dresses
and
her
large
knew
but
she
had
everything
that
he
had
he
reached
he
found
his
servant
waiting
up
for
sent
him
to
and
threw
himself
down
on
the
sofa
in
the
and
began
to
think
over
some
of
the
things
that
had
said
to
it
really
true
that
one
could
never
felt
a
wild
longing
for
the
purity
of
his
as
had
once
called
knew
that
he
had
filled
his
mind
with
corruption
and
given
horror
to
his
that
he
had
been
an
evil
influence
to
and
had
experienced
a
terrible
joy
in
being
and
that
of
the
lives
that
had
crossed
his
it
had
been
the
and
the
most
full
of
promise
that
he
had
brought
to
was
it
all
there
no
hope
for
in
what
a
moment
of
pride
and
passion
he
had
that
the
portrait
should
bear
the
burden
of
his
and
he
keep
the
of
eternal
his
failure
had
been
due
to
for
him
that
each
sin
of
his
life
had
brought
its
sure
swift
penalty
along
with
was
purification
in
us
our
but
us
for
our
should
be
the
prayer
of
man
to
a
most
just
carved
mirror
that
had
given
to
so
many
years
ago
was
standing
on
the
and
the
laughed
round
it
as
of
took
it
as
he
had
done
on
that
night
of
horror
when
he
had
first
noted
the
change
in
the
fatal
and
with
eyes
looked
into
its
polished
some
one
who
had
terribly
loved
him
had
written
to
him
a
mad
ending
with
these
world
is
changed
because
you
are
made
of
ivory
and
curves
of
your
lips
rewrite
phrases
came
back
to
his
and
he
repeated
them
over
and
over
to
he
his
own
and
the
mirror
on
the
crushed
it
into
silver
beneath
his
was
his
beauty
that
had
ruined
his
beauty
and
the
youth
that
he
had
for
those
two
his
life
might
have
been
free
from
beauty
had
been
to
him
but
a
his
youth
but
a
was

at
an
a
time
of
shallow
and
had
he
worn

of

of
and
of
his
own
that
he
had
to

hidden
in
a
grave
in
had
shot
himself
one
night
in
his
but
had
not
revealed
the
secret
that
he
had
been
forced
to
such
as
it
over
would
soon
pass
was
already
was
perfectly
safe
was
it
the
death
of
that
weighed
most
upon
his
was
the
living
death
of
his
own
soul
that
troubled
had
painted
the
portrait
that
had
his
could
not
forgive
him
was
the
portrait
that
had
done
had
said
things
to
him
that
were
and
that
he
had
yet
borne
with
murder
had
been
simply
the
madness
of
a
for
his
suicide
had
been
his
own
had
chosen
to
do

nothing
to
new

what
he

innocent

began
to
wonder
if
the
portrait
in
the
locked
room
had
it
was
not
still
so
horrible
as
it
had
if
his
life
became
he
would
be
able
to
every
sign
of
evil
passion
from
the
the
signs
of
evil
had
already
gone
would
go
and
took
the
lamp
from
the
table
and
he
the
a
smile
of
joy
across
his
face
and
for
a
moment
about
his
he
would
be
and
the
thing
that
he
had
hidden
away
would
no
longer
be
a
terror
to

as
if
the
load
had
been
lifted
from
him
went
in
locking
the
door
behind
as
was
his
and
dragged
the
purple
hanging
from
the
cry
of
pain
and
broke
from

see
no
save
that
in
the
eyes
there
was
a
look
of
cunning
and
in
the
mouth
the
curved
of
the
thing

still

than
the
scarlet
dew
that
spotted

more
like

him

for
a
new

with
his
that
passion
to
act
a
part
that
sometimes
makes
us
do
things
than
we
are
all
why

the
red
stain
larger
than
it
had

to
have
like
a
horrible
disease
over
